My mother died when I was 16. My dad married another woman two years later.

My grandparents, my dad's parents, HATE my stepmother. I really don't like her either.

Even after my half-siblings were born, my grandparents never warmed up to her.

My grandparents are quite wealthy. My father has been banking on this inheritance for a while. He has even been not paying into his retirement because he's so sure that he will inherit the millions.

I just found out on Saturday that I'm getting the majority of my grandparents estate. My father is getting a token amount of $50000 so he can't dispute it.

My grandparents made me promise not to give out any money after and I intend to keep  my word.

But I do feel really guilty that my father just spends his money as it's coming in because he's relying on money he won't get.

I also found out my dad is in a lot of debt.

AITA for not telling him?
