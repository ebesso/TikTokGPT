I’m Asian, more specifically one of the only Chinese people in my grade, which has been absolutely fun these days. 

So the girl in question, has been racially harassing me since the beginning of lockdown, when she dmed and said “did the bat taste good? thanks a lot you fucking freak”. I reported her to my school, and they literally just dropped it because they said tensions were high, and she couldn’t be blamed because her uncle had corona, some BS like that. Then I got repeated messages like that from fake/newly created accounts, that I suspect were from her, and I just kept blocking them until I guess she gave up because I wasn’t reacting. 

My school district has chosen to do in person, massively dumb imo, but whatever. On the literal second day of school, she walks up to me while I’m in the lunch line and says in a thick asian accent, “Are you eating bat dumpring or dog noodle?” 

Other people around me fucking laughed, and I’m sure I don’t have to explain this, but I felt fucking humiliated. It finally felt like I got her off my back for a little while, and she comes back as soon as school starts, and I already know my school administration isn’t going to go to bat for me. 

I don’t know a lot about this girl, since obviously I try to avoid her, but I did know that she had shitty teeth, lived in a trailer, and was very poor. I’m ashamed to have stooped to this, but I just wanted to show her how I felt for once, so I said, “I’d be less concerned with what I’m eating if I were you, and more worried about your diet, since you’re the one who needs to figure out how to brush her teeth in a trailer with no running water. Stop trying to get sent to a hospital when you can’t afford healthcare.” 

Other students nearby told me I went too far because “it wasn’t her fault she was poor” LIKE IT WAS MY FAULT I WAS ASIAN?!?! She literally fucking cried, like I didn’t cry everytime she called me a fucking chink. She’s left me alone ever since though, which doesn’t matter since I plan on transferring anyways.
